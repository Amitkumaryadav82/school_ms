# Component Scanning Fix for School Management System

## Issue

The application failed to start with the following error:

```
No qualifying bean of type 'com.example.schoolms.service.StaffService' available: expected at least 1 bean which qualifies as autowire candidate. Dependency annotations: {@org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Qualifier("exampleSchoolmsStaffServiceImpl")}
```

## Root Cause

The `SchoolApplication.java` file was only scanning components, entities, and repositories in the `com.school` package hierarchy, but important service implementations like `StaffServiceImpl` were located in the `com.example.schoolms` package hierarchy.

This resulted in Spring Boot not finding and registering these classes as beans in the application context, leading to dependency injection failures.

## Solution

Updated the component scanning configuration in `SchoolApplication.java` to include both package hierarchies:

```java
// Updated component scanning to include both package structures
@ComponentScan(basePackages = { "com.school", "com.example.schoolms" })
// Updated entity scanning to include both package structures
@EntityScan(basePackages = { "com.school", "com.example.schoolms" })
// Updated repository scanning to include both package structures
@EnableJpaRepositories(basePackages = { "com.school", "com.example.schoolms" })
```

## Long-term Strategy

As part of the ongoing simplification effort:

1. **Package Consolidation**: Gradually move all classes from `com.example.schoolms` to `com.school` to simplify package structure.

2. **Updated Documentation**: Ensure all new components are added to the `com.school` package hierarchy.

3. **Migration Plan**: Create a migration plan to move remaining classes from the old package structure to the new one.

## Related Issues

- This change is connected to the qualifier standardization effort documented in [QUALIFIER-STANDARDIZATION.md](backend/QUALIFIER-STANDARDIZATION.md).
- The package structure inconsistency may be contributing to other dependency injection issues in the application.

## Verification

After implementing this fix:

1. The application should start successfully
2. All services from both package hierarchies should be properly injected
3. The StaffServiceAdapter should function correctly with the StaffServiceImpl bean
