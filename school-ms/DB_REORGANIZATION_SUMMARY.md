# Database Reorganization Summary

## Changes Made

As part of our database schema organization efforts, we have:

1. Created a centralized `DB_Schema` folder at the root of the project
2. Copied and organized all SQL files from various locations into this folder:
   - Main schema definition
   - Module-specific schemas (library, etc.)
   - Migration scripts
   - Seed data scripts
   - Test data scripts
3. Moved migration scripts to a dedicated `DB_Schema/migration_scripts` subdirectory
4. Created README.md files in the DB_Schema directory and its subdirectories explaining the purpose and usage of each file

## Benefits

This reorganization provides several benefits:

1. **Improved Visibility**: All database-related files are now in one place
2. **Better Documentation**: Each file is properly described in the README
3. **Easier Onboarding**: New team members can quickly understand the database structure
4. **Simplified Maintenance**: Changes to the database schema can be tracked more easily

## Original Files

The original schema files have been removed from their previous locations after being copied to the DB_Schema folder. The only exception is:

- Flyway migration file (`V20250614__consolidate_staff_tables.sql`): This file remains in its original location within the application's Flyway migration directory structure, with a copy in the DB_Schema folder for reference.

## Next Steps

To maintain the database organization:

1. Ensure any new database scripts are added to the DB_Schema folder
2. Update documentation to reference the centralized schema files
3. For any new Flyway migrations, create copies in the DB_Schema folder for documentation purposes
4. Make sure build scripts are updated to reference the new file locations where necessary
