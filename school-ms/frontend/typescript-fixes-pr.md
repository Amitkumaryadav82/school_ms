# TypeScript Error Fixes for School Management System Frontend

## Summary of Fixes

This PR addresses several TypeScript errors in the School Management System frontend:

1. Fixed `selectedPayment.feeBreakdown` possibly undefined error in `PaymentHistory.tsx`
2. Added `description` property to `FeeBreakdownItem` interface in `payment.types.ts`
3. Fixed duplicate `StudentFeeDetails` interface in `payment.types.ts`
4. Updated import statements in `PaymentReceipt.tsx` to use the default export of `feeService`
5. Fixed type mismatch between `StudentFeeDetails` and `StudentFeeDetailsType` in `FeeManagement.tsx`

## Detailed Changes

### 1. Payment History Component
- Added optional chaining operator (?.) to handle possibly undefined `feeBreakdown`
- Made `description` optional and added default display when undefined

### 2. Payment Types
- Added `description` property to `FeeBreakdownItem` interface
- Removed duplicate `StudentFeeDetails` interface and merged properties into a single interface

### 3. Fee Service
- Fixed `downloadReceipt` implementation to handle blob responses correctly
- Updated import statement in `PaymentReceipt.tsx` to use the default export from `feeService`

### 4. Fee Management Component
- Fixed type incompatibility by directly using the `StudentFeeDetails` type from payment types
- Updated import statements to avoid duplicate type declarations

## Testing

All TypeScript errors have been resolved. The application builds successfully without any TypeScript errors.
