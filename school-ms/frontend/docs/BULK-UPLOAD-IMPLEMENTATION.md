# Bulk Upload Weekly Enhancement Implementation

This document outlines the implementation details for enhancing the Bulk Upload feature to support weekly attendance uploads.

## Implementation Strategy

1. Enhance the AttendanceUpload component to allow weekly uploads
2. Use existing backend APIs only (no new backend APIs)
3. Process weekly uploads on the client side

## Technical Approach

1. Add a toggle between "Single Day" and "Weekly" modes
2. Add date range selection for weekly mode
3. Enhance the template generation/download
4. Implement client-side processing for weekly uploads
5. Provide detailed progress and results

## Step-by-step Implementation

### 1. Update AttendanceUpload Component

- Add new state variables for upload mode and date range
- Add toggle buttons for mode selection
- Add date range pickers for weekly mode
- Update validation logic to handle weekly uploads

### 2. Implement Weekly Upload Processing

- Parse CSV file data
- Process each day in the selected week
- Make calls to existing APIs
- Track progress and handle errors

### 3. Update UI to Show Upload Progress and Results

- Add progress indicators
- Show detailed results for each day
- Implement retry functionality for failed days

## Key Functions Added

1. `processWeeklyUpload`: Processes a weekly attendance CSV file by making multiple calls to existing APIs
2. `parseWeeklyCSV`: Parses a weekly CSV file into daily attendance records
3. `formatWeeklyTemplate`: Formats data for the weekly template download

## Using Existing Backend APIs

We're using these existing APIs for the implementation:

- `employeeAttendanceService.uploadAttendanceFile`: For single-day uploads
- `employeeAttendanceService.downloadAttendanceTemplate`: For template downloads
- `employeeAttendanceService.markBulkAttendance`: For processing attendance data

## Important Notes

1. This implementation doesn't require any changes to the backend
2. All processing for weekly uploads is done on the client side
3. Existing single-day upload functionality is preserved
