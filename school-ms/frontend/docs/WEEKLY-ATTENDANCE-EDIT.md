# Weekly Attendance Edit Improvement

## Overview

This document describes the changes made to the Weekly Attendance View to improve user experience by replacing multiple individual day edit buttons with a single action per staff member.

## Before the Change

Previously, the Weekly Attendance View displayed:
- A table with staff members as rows
- Each day of the week as columns
- An edit button for each day of the week for each staff member
- Users had to click on individual day edit buttons to update attendance for a single day

## After the Change

The new Weekly Attendance View now features:
- A table with staff members as rows
- Each day of the week as columns (unchanged)
- A single action column with a calendar icon button for each staff member
- Clicking this button takes the user to a dedicated page to edit the entire week's attendance for that specific staff member

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**: Administrators can now edit an entire week's attendance for a staff member from a single interface rather than day-by-day

2. **Consistency**: Ensures that attendance updates for a staff member are applied consistently across the entire week

3. **Efficiency**: Fewer clicks required to update multiple days of attendance

4. **Better Overview**: Provides a comprehensive view of a staff member's attendance for the entire week during editing

## Implementation Details

1. **New Component**: Created `AttendanceWeeklyEdit.tsx` to handle editing attendance for an entire week
   - Displays employee details
   - Shows a card for each day of the week with status selection
   - Provides a single "Save All Changes" button to update all records at once

2. **Modified Weekly View**: Updated `AttendanceWeeklyView.tsx` to:
   - Remove individual day edit buttons
   - Add a single action column with an edit button
   - Use React Router navigation instead of page reload

3. **New Route**: Added a dedicated route for the weekly edit view
   - Path: `/staff-weekly-attendance/:employeeId`
   - Protected route with proper role-based access control

4. **API Path Corrections**: Ensured all API paths use the correct `/api` prefix for consistency

## Technical Notes

- Token validation is performed before saving to prevent session timeouts
- Used React Router's `useNavigate` hook for smooth transitions between views
- Holiday dates are automatically marked and disabled in the edit view
- Supports both creating new attendance records and updating existing ones
