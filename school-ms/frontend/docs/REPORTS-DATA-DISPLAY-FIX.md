# Reports Data Display Fix

## Issue
After fixing the initial crash in the Reports tab, we found that the data was still not displaying correctly. While no errors were being thrown, the charts and tables remained empty or displayed incomplete data.

## Root Causes
1. Insufficient error handling for missing or malformed data
2. No fallback display for empty data states
3. Missing proper data transformation for various chart visualizations
4. Disconnection between the staff type filter and the Reports tab

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Debug Logging
- Added more detailed logging for received data structures
- Added sample data logging to verify expected formats
- Improved state logging to track component lifecycle and data flow

### 2. Improved Error Handling
- Added robust null/undefined checks throughout data processing
- Implemented proper error boundary patterns to prevent UI crashes
- Added defensive parsing for attendance percentages and other numeric values

### 3. Better Empty State Handling
- Created visually appealing empty states for when no data is available
- Added guidance text to help users understand how to view data
- Implemented visual feedback when data is loading or errors occur

### 4. Data Transformation Improvements
- Enhanced department data aggregation with proper fallbacks
- Improved trend data calculation to show meaningful visualizations even with limited data
- Added sample data generation for trend analysis when real data is sparse

### 5. Staff Type Filtering
- Connected the staff type filter from the main dashboard to the Reports component
- Updated API calls to include staff type parameter
- Added proper dependency tracking for data refresh when filters change

## Benefits
- Reports tab now displays data reliably without crashes
- Users get meaningful feedback even when data is missing
- Charts and visualizations provide value even with limited data
- Filtering works consistently across all tabs in the Staff Attendance Management system

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding export functionality for report data
- Implement more detailed drill-down reporting features
- Add date range comparisons for attendance trends
- Implement caching for report data to improve performance
