# Reports Tab Temporary Fix

## Issue
The Reports tab in the Staff Attendance Management system was encountering errors when trying to load due to:

1. React hook import issues in the `AttendanceReports.tsx` component
2. Backend API connectivity problems
3. Missing error handling for certain API responses

## Solution
A temporary skeleton implementation of the Reports tab has been created to allow the frontend development to proceed without dependency on the backend APIs.

### Changes Made:

1. Created a new component `AttendanceReportsSkeleton.tsx` that:
   - Shows the same tab structure as the original component
   - Has placeholder content for each tab
   - Doesn't make any API calls
   - Is visually similar to the original Reports tab

2. Updated `StaffAttendance.tsx` to:
   - Import the new skeleton component instead of the original
   - Use the skeleton component in the Reports tab panel

## Benefits

1. The Reports tab now loads and displays without errors
2. Frontend development can continue without waiting for backend API fixes
3. Users can see a preview of what the Reports tab will look like
4. The application no longer crashes when navigating to the Reports tab

## Next Steps

Once the backend API issues are resolved, we should:

1. Debug and fix the original `AttendanceReports.tsx` component
2. Re-enable the API calls with proper error handling
3. Replace the skeleton implementation with the fully functional one
4. Ensure all data is properly displayed with appropriate error states

## API Endpoints Needed

The following backend API endpoints need to be working for the full Reports tab implementation:

1. `GET /staff?employmentStatus=ACTIVE&roleFilter=Teacher` - To fetch active teachers
2. `GET /api/staff/attendance/stats/employee/{employeeId}?startDate={startDate}&endDate={endDate}` - For individual teacher stats
3. `GET /api/staff/attendance/report/monthly?year={year}&month={month}&employeeType={employeeType}` - For monthly reports
