# Staff Attendance Feature Issues and Fixes

## Recent Issues

### 1. "No teachers found" in Weekly Attendance View

**Issue:** After removing the Monthly and Calendar View tabs from the Staff Attendance management UI, the Weekly View stopped displaying teachers - showing "No teachers found" instead.

**Root Causes:**
- The `staffType` prop was being passed to `AttendanceWeeklyView` but not defined in the component's props interface
- Incorrect API endpoint in `getActiveTeachers()` method (missing `/api` prefix)
- No error handling to identify API response issues

**Fixes:**
1. Added `staffType` prop to the `AttendanceWeeklyViewProps` interface
2. Updated staffService's `getActiveTeachers()` method to:
   - Accept the staffType parameter
   - Use the correct endpoint path: `/api/staff`
   - Add debugging and error logging
3. Enhanced useApi dependencies to properly react to staffType changes
4. Added better error messages in the UI

### 2. Connection Issues with Backend

**Issue:** Frontend was failing to connect to the backend with connection refused errors.

**Root Causes:**
- Backend server was not running or was inaccessible
- Failed fallbacks to alternative ports (3000, 5000)

**Fixes:**
1. Created `run-backend-fixed.bat` with proper error handling to reliably start the backend
2. Improved connection diagnostics with clearer error reporting
3. Created a comprehensive troubleshooting guide: `BACKEND-CONNECTION-TROUBLESHOOTING.md`

## Best Practices for Future Development

1. **API Path Consistency**
   - Always use `/api/...` prefix for backend calls
   - Use environment variables for API base URLs

2. **Props and Interfaces**
   - Always define proper TypeScript interfaces for component props
   - Update interfaces when passing new props to components

3. **Error Handling**
   - Add comprehensive error logging
   - Display user-friendly error messages
   - Use specific error messages for different failure scenarios

4. **Debugging**
   - Add logging for API request parameters
   - Log response data statistics (count, sample data)
   - Use browser developer tools to monitor network requests

5. **Documentation**
   - Document all changes in markdown files
   - Create troubleshooting guides for common issues
