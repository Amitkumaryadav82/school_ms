# Attendance API Frontend Fixes

## Issues and Fixes

The consolidation of staff attendance endpoints led to some frontend API errors. This document explains the issues and fixes that were applied.

### Problem Summary

1. The backend endpoint paths were updated in `EmployeeAttendanceController` to use `/api/staff/attendance/employee/date/{date}` but the frontend service was still using `/api/staff/attendance/date/{date}`.

2. Several frontend components were still using the old service files:
   - `teacherAttendanceService.ts`
   - `staffAttendanceService.ts`

3. Some components were using `SchoolHoliday` type instead of `HolidayDTO` from the consolidated service.

### Fixes Applied

1. Updated endpoint paths in `employeeAttendanceService.ts`:
   - Changed `/api/staff/attendance/date/${date}` to `/api/staff/attendance/employee/date/${date}`

2. Updated all components to use the new consolidated `employeeAttendanceService`:
   - `HolidayManagement.tsx`
   - `AttendanceUpload.tsx`
   - `AttendanceReports.tsx`
   - `AttendanceMonthlyView.tsx`
   - `AttendanceCalendarView.tsx`

3. Updated type references:
   - Changed `SchoolHoliday` to `HolidayDTO`
   - Changed `AttendanceStatus` to `EmployeeAttendanceStatus`
   - Updated other related types

4. Enhanced API error logging:
   - Added specific logging for attendance API errors to aid in debugging

## Next Steps

1. Verify that all endpoints are working correctly with the updated paths
2. Consider removing the old service files (`teacherAttendanceService.ts` and `staffAttendanceService.ts`) once all components are migrated
3. Update any remaining components or services that might still be using the old endpoints
4. Update automated tests to use the new endpoints
5. Create a deprecation plan for the legacy endpoint redirects in the backend

- Backend:
  - `/api/staff/attendance/employee/date/{date}` in `EmployeeAttendanceController.java`
  
- Frontend:
  - `employeeAttendanceService.ts` - Updated endpoint paths
  - Various attendance components updated to use the new service

## Testing

Verify the fix by:
1. Open the attendance views for a specific date (e.g., 2025-06-27)
2. Check the browser console for any API errors
3. Verify data is loading properly in all attendance views
