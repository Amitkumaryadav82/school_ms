# Weekly Attendance View Fix

## Issue
After removing the Calendar and Monthly tabs from the Staff Attendance management UI, the Weekly View stopped displaying teachers with "No teachers found" error.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. The `staffType` prop was being passed to `AttendanceWeeklyView` component from the parent `StaffAttendance` component, but the component wasn't properly defining or consuming it.
2. The `getActiveTeachers` function in staffService didn't accept a staffType parameter to filter teachers.
3. The attendance data request wasn't using the staffType filter either.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed `AttendanceWeeklyView` component to accept staffType prop
```tsx
interface AttendanceWeeklyViewProps {
  startDate: string;
  endDate: string;
  isAdmin: boolean;
  staffType?: string; // Added staffType prop
}
```

### 2. Updated `getActiveTeachers` in staffService to accept staffType parameter
```typescript
getActiveTeachers: async (staffType = 'ALL') => {
  try {
    const response = await api.get('staff', {
      params: {
        employmentStatus: 'ACTIVE',
        roleFilter: 'Teacher',
        employeeType: staffType !== 'ALL' ? staffType : undefined
      }
    });
    // Apply type assertion to safely access response data
    const typedResponse = response as any;
    return typedResponse.data || [];
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching active teachers:', error);
    return [];
  }
},
```

### 3. Enhanced error message for "No teachers found" to include staff type information
```tsx
<TableCell colSpan={3 + dates.length} align="center">
  No teachers found for staff type: {staffType}. Please check filters or network connectivity.
</TableCell>
```

### 4. Added logging statements for easier debugging
- Added console logs to track staffType throughout the component lifecycle
- Added logs showing the number of teachers retrieved from API

### 5. Fixed dependencies in useApi calls
- Added staffType to the attendance data API call
- Updated useApi dependencies arrays to include staffType

## Testing
The Weekly View should now properly handle the staffType filter and display teachers based on the selected filter in the dropdown. If no teachers are found, a more descriptive error message will be shown.
