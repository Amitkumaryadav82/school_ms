# Dashboard Redirect Fix

## Problem
When users clicked on the Dashboard menu item, they were being incorrectly logged out or redirected to the homepage instead of simply refreshing the dashboard statistics.

## Root Causes

1. **Aggressive Token Validation**: The token validation in Dashboard.tsx was too strict, causing users to be logged out when token validation failed, even for minor issues.

2. **Dashboard Route Handling**: Route handling in the application was causing unwanted redirects from the Dashboard page.

3. **Race Condition**: A race condition existed between the token validation and component mounting process.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Prevention of Unwanted Redirects
Added code to detect when the user is incorrectly redirected to the homepage and automatically redirect back to the dashboard:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  const preventHomepageRedirect = () => {
    const currentPath = window.location.pathname;
    const wasRedirected = sessionStorage.getItem('dashboard_redirected');
    
    // If we're at root path but should be viewing dashboard, redirect back
    if (currentPath === '/' && !wasRedirected && user) {
      sessionStorage.setItem('dashboard_redirected', 'true');
      navigate('/dashboard');
      
      // Clear flag after 5 seconds
      setTimeout(() => {
        sessionStorage.removeItem('dashboard_redirected');
      }, 5000);
    }
  };
  
  preventHomepageRedirect();
}, [navigate, user]);
```

### 2. Refactored Token Validation Logic
Completely refactored the token validation process in Dashboard.tsx:

- Skip validation entirely when already on the dashboard page
- Use minimal token checking to avoid unnecessary API calls
- Prevent logout from dashboard even when token issues are detected
- Handle token expiration gracefully with background refresh attempts
- Increased delay before validation to ensure component is fully mounted

### 3. Enhanced API Error Handling
Updated API error handling to better handle dashboard-related requests.

## Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Log in to the application
2. Navigate to different pages
3. Click on the Dashboard menu item
4. The dashboard should refresh correctly without redirecting or logging out
5. Check the browser console for any "redirected back to dashboard" messages

## Additional Notes

This fix aims to balance proper token validation with a good user experience. Users will not experience unnecessary logout while still maintaining strong security. The system will still log users out when truly necessary (e.g., after long periods of inactivity).
