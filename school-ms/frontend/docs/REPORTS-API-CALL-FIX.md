# Reports API Call Error Fix

## Issue

When clicking on the "Reports" tab in the Staff Attendance Management system, the following errors were appearing in the console:

1. `Staff data loading error: No staff members found through any method`
2. `AuthService: No token to validate`

## Root Cause

The root cause of this issue was identified as a syntax error in the `AttendanceReportsImpl.tsx` file. Specifically, in the API call for fetching monthly attendance data, there was a malformed method call:

```typescript
// Incorrect code
return employeeAttendanceService.2AttendanceReportsImpl.tsx:434 Staff data loading error: No staff members found through any method
AttendanceReportsImpl @ AttendanceReportsImpl.tsx:434Understand this error
authService.ts:242 ‚ùå AuthService: No token to validate(
  monthStartDate.format('YYYY-MM-DD'), 
  monthEndDate.format('YYYY-MM-DD'),
  staffType
);
```

This code appeared to have debug/error text accidentally pasted into the method name, causing a syntax error that prevented the API call from executing correctly.

## Fix

The code was fixed by restoring the correct API method call:

```typescript
// Fixed code
return employeeAttendanceService.getAttendanceByDateRange(
  monthStartDate.format('YYYY-MM-DD'), 
  monthEndDate.format('YYYY-MM-DD'),
  staffType
);
```

## Authentication Error

The secondary error `AuthService: No token to validate` was a result of the first error. Because the API call was malformed, the authentication flow was not properly initiated, causing the auth service to log this error when trying to validate the token.

## Verification

After applying the fix, the Reports tab should load correctly and display attendance data without any console errors related to API calls or authentication.
