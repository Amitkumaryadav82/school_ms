# Staff Report Loading Error Fix

## Issue
The Reports tab was failing to load staff data and showing the following error:
`AttendanceReportsImpl.tsx:395 Staff data loading error: An unexpected error occurred.`

## Root Cause Analysis
1. The issue was caused by a mismatched import statement in `AttendanceReportsImpl.tsx`
   - The file was importing the staffService as a named import `import { staffService }` 
   - But the actual export in `staffService.ts` was a default export `export default staffService`

2. Additionally, there were issues with error handling in the `getAll` method of `staffService`:
   - The error handling wasn't robust enough to handle different response formats
   - The service wasn't trying alternative methods to get staff data when the primary method failed

## Changes Made

1. Fixed the import statement in `AttendanceReportsImpl.tsx`:
   - Changed from `import { staffService } from '../../services/staffService'`
   - To `import staffService from '../../services/staffService'`

2. Enhanced the `getAll` method in `staffService.ts`:
   - Improved error handling and response validation
   - Added a fallback approach that combines data from `getActiveTeachers()` and `getNonTeachingStaff()`
   - Added more detailed logging to help diagnose issues in the future
   - Ensured consistent error handling throughout the method

3. Fixed an issue with duplicate `getAll` method declarations in the staffService object

## Result
The Reports tab now properly loads staff data for the Individual Reports section. The system first
tries to fetch all staff directly, and if that fails, it falls back to combining separate calls
for active teachers and non-teaching staff.
