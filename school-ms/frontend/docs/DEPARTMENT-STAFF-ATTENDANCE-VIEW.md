# Department-Specific Staff Attendance View

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of the department-specific staff attendance view feature in the Staff Attendance Management system. When a specific department is selected in the Department Reports tab, the system now shows a detailed table of all staff members in that department along with their daily attendance status for the selected month.

## Feature Description

1. **Conditional Display**:
   - When "All Departments" is selected: Shows department-wide charts and performance metrics
   - When a specific department is selected: Shows a detailed staff attendance table

2. **Staff Attendance Table**:
   - Staff name and position columns
   - One column for each day of the month showing attendance status
   - Summary columns showing present days, absent days, leave days, half days, and attendance percentage
   - Color-coded status indicators for better visual distinction

3. **Attendance Status Abbreviations**:
   - P: Present (green)
   - A: Absent (red)
   - L: Leave (yellow)
   - H: Holiday (gray)
   - Half days and other statuses as applicable

## Implementation Details

1. **Conditional Rendering**:
   - The UI checks if `selectedDepartment === 'ALL'` to determine which view to show

2. **Data Filtering**:
   - Uses the existing `filteredSummaries` logic which already filters by department
   - Leverages the `monthlyReport` data structure which includes `dailyStatus` for each employee

3. **Table Design**:
   - Horizontally scrollable to accommodate all days of the month
   - Compact design with small cell size for efficient space usage
   - Color coding for quick visual identification of attendance patterns

4. **Staff Position Display**:
   - Looks up staff position from the `allStaff` array using the employee ID

## Technical Implementation

The implementation uses only the existing backend APIs and processes all data client-side:

1. `getAll` from staffService - Gets all staff data including department information
2. `getAttendanceByDateRange` - Gets attendance records for the selected month
3. The MonthlyAttendanceReport data structure already includes all necessary information:
   - Employee summaries with daily status for each day
   - Attendance statistics for each employee

## User Experience Benefits

1. **Improved Focus**: When looking at a specific department, users see only the relevant staff members
2. **Detailed View**: Daily attendance patterns are visible at a glance
3. **Summary Statistics**: Quick overview of attendance metrics for each staff member
4. **Consistent Download**: The CSV download function works the same way, but with filtered data

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements:
1. Additional filtering options (by position, attendance percentage, etc.)
2. Ability to edit attendance directly from the table
3. Attendance trend visualization for individual staff members
4. Sorting options for the staff list (by name, attendance percentage, etc.)
