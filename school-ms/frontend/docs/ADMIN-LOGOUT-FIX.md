# Admin Logout Issue Resolution

## Problem
Admin users were being logged out immediately after clicking on the dashboard in the School Management System application.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Token Validation Issues**: The system was not properly validating JWT tokens or handling their expiration gracefully.
2. **Role Checking Logic**: The RoleBasedRoute component had issues with the role verification process, particularly for Admin users.
3. **Missing Token Refresh**: No mechanism existed to refresh tokens that were about to expire.
4. **Inconsistent Role Formats**: Different parts of the application expected roles in different formats (string vs array).

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Token Refresh Mechanism
- Created a `tokenRefreshService.ts` service that handles:
  - Token validation and expiration checking
  - Communication with backend refresh endpoint
  - Request queueing during refresh operations
  - Detailed logging for debugging

### 2. Backend Refresh Endpoint
- Added `/api/auth/refresh` endpoint to refresh expired tokens
- Implemented validation logic to ensure token security
- Added appropriate error handling

### 3. Enhanced RoleBasedRoute Component
- Improved role checking logic to handle both string and array role formats
- Added special handling for Admin users to prevent false permission denials
- Implemented detailed logging for access attempts

### 4. Improved AuthContext
- Added token validation on initial app load
- Implemented token refresh in the authentication context
- Fixed role format inconsistencies
- Enhanced user inactivity tracking

### 5. API Error Handling
- Improved handling of 401 Unauthorized responses
- Added automatic token refresh on certain authentication errors
- Enhanced error logging and diagnostics

### 6. User Preferences and Diagnostics
- Created a `userPreferencesService.ts` for tracking user settings
- Implemented access logging for debugging authentication issues
- Added diagnostics capabilities for troubleshooting

### 7. Dashboard Component Enhancement
- Added token validation before API calls
- Implemented proactive token refresh when tokens are about to expire
- Added detailed error handling for authentication failures

## Files Modified
1. `frontend/src/services/tokenRefreshService.ts` (created)
2. `frontend/src/services/userPreferencesService.ts` (created)
3. `frontend/src/services/api.ts`
4. `frontend/src/context/AuthContext.tsx`
5. `frontend/src/components/RoleBasedRoute.tsx`
6. `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`
7. `backend/school-app/src/main/java/com/school/security/AuthController.java`
8. `backend/school-app/src/main/java/com/school/security/AuthService.java`

## Documentation Added
- Created `AUTHENTICATION-FLOW.md` explaining the authentication process
- Added detailed comments throughout the code

## Testing Performed
The solution was tested by:
1. Verifying Admin users can access the dashboard without being logged out
2. Testing token expiration and automatic refresh
3. Validating role-based access control for different user types
4. Ensuring error handling works correctly for various authentication failures

## Next Steps
1. Consider implementing refresh tokens for enhanced security
2. Add server-side session tracking for additional security
3. Implement client-side encryption for stored tokens
4. Add additional automated tests for authentication workflows

## Conclusion
The implemented solution provides a robust authentication system that:
- Prevents unintended logouts for Admin users
- Handles token expiration gracefully
- Provides proper role-based access control
- Offers detailed diagnostics for troubleshooting
