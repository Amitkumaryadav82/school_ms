# Connection Management System Improvements

## Summary of Changes Made

We've implemented a comprehensive connection management system for the School Management System application by:

1. **Created a Centralized ConnectionContext**
   - Added `ConnectionContext.tsx` to manage connection state across the application
   - Added TypeScript definitions in `ConnectionContext.d.ts` for better type safety
   - Implemented connection monitoring with periodic checks

2. **Refactored Existing Components to Use the Context**
   - Updated `ConnectionStatusIndicator.tsx` to use the connection context
   - Updated `ConnectionSettings.tsx` to use shared context state
   - Updated `ConnectionError.tsx` to use context methods
   - Updated `ConnectionDiagnosticsTool.tsx` to use context for settings
   - Updated `NetworkErrorBoundary.tsx` to integrate with connection context

3. **Added Global Access to Connection Settings**
   - Created a `GlobalConnectionSettings.tsx` component that can be rendered at the app root
   - This allows access to connection settings from anywhere in the app

4. **Improved Architecture**
   - Centralized connection state management
   - Reduced duplicate code across components
   - Improved state sharing between components
   - Added better error handling for connection issues

5. **Added Comprehensive Documentation**
   - Created `CONNECTION-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM.md` with detailed documentation
   - Included examples of how to use the connection system in various scenarios
   - Documented error handling strategies

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**
   - Real-time connection status visibility in the UI
   - Consistent connection error handling
   - One-click access to connection settings from anywhere

2. **Developer Experience**
   - Simplified API for connection management with the `useConnection` hook
   - Reduced code duplication across components
   - Type-safe interactions with connection state

3. **Reliability**
   - Automatic detection of API URLs
   - Periodic connection checks to ensure continued connectivity
   - Proper handling of connection recovery

4. **Maintainability**
   - Centralized logic in ConnectionContext
   - Simplified component code by removing connection management logic
   - Well-documented code for easier future development

## Testing

All components have been verified to work together correctly:
- Connection status indicator shows correct state
- Connection settings dialog opens and applies changes
- Error components use the context to handle connection issues
- Connection diagnostics tool correctly interacts with settings

## Future Work

1. Add WebSocket-based real-time connection monitoring
2. Implement offline mode support
3. Add more detailed network diagnostics
4. Track performance metrics
5. Implement automatic reconnection strategies
