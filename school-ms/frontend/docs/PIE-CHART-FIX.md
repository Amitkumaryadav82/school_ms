# Pie Chart Display Fix

## Issue
In the Staff Attendance Management system's Individual Reports section, the pie chart was not displaying labels correctly. The labels for "Present", "Absent", "Half Day", and "Leave" were overlapping and not readable.

## Changes Made

1. Removed direct labels from pie slices:
   - Set `label={false}` to prevent text from rendering directly on the pie chart
   - Set `labelLine={false}` to remove connecting lines that were adding to the visual clutter

2. Enhanced the legend and tooltip display:
   - Configured Legend component with explicit layout settings for better positioning
   - Added a custom tooltip formatter to show both days and percentages
   - Added a helper function `calculatePercentage` to compute accurate percentages

3. Improved chart container sizing:
   - Increased the chart height from 250px to 300px for better spacing
   - Added top margin to separate the chart from the title
   - Set explicit width and height for the ResponsiveContainer

## Result
The pie chart now displays properly with clear labels in the legend below the chart instead of cluttered text overlapping the pie slices. The tooltips provide detailed information showing both days and percentage values when hovering over each slice.
