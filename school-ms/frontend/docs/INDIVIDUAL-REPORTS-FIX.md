# Individual Reports Fix and Enhancement

## Issue
In the Staff Attendance Management system's Reports tab, the Individual Reports section was not displaying data for all staff members. The dropdown was filtering to only show teachers, excluding other staff types.

## Changes Made

1. Changed filtering logic to include all staff members:
   - Renamed `teachers` variable to `filteredStaff`
   - Removed filter that restricted to only teacher roles
   - Now filtering only by:
     - Staff type (if specified)
     - Active employment status
   - Added alphabetical sorting for better usability

2. Updated UI labels:
   - Changed "Select Teacher" to "Select Staff Member"
   - Updated placeholder text and function names to be more inclusive

3. Renamed variables for clarity:
   - `selectedTeacher` → `selectedStaffMember`
   - `teacherAttendance` → `staffAttendance`
   - `getTeacherName` → `getStaffName`

4. Enhanced error handling:
   - Added more specific error messages for different types of failures
   - Added detailed console logging to help with debugging
   - Improved user-facing error messages

5. Improved empty states:
   - Added more helpful messages when no attendance data is found
   - Added guidance text for selecting date ranges

6. Added performance optimization:
   - Added detailed logging for debugging data loading issues
   - Added data validation to protect against unexpected null values

## Result
The Individual Reports section now properly displays all staff members in the dropdown, allowing users to select any staff member (not just teachers) to view their attendance reports. The improved error handling and user feedback make the system more robust and user-friendly.
