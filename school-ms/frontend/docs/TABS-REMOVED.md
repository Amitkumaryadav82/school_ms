# Tabs Removed Documentation

## Overview

This document details the tabs that were removed from the Staff Attendance Management UI to simplify the interface and focus on the most used features.

## Tabs Removed

The following tabs have been removed from the Staff Attendance Management UI:

1. **Monthly Tab** - Provided a monthly view of staff attendance
2. **Calendar View Tab** - Provided a calendar visualization of attendance

## Changes Made

1. Removed imports for:
   - `CalendarMonth` icon from '@mui/icons-material'
   - `AttendanceCalendarView` component
   - `AttendanceMonthlyView` component

2. Removed state variable:
   - `selectedMonth` - Was used for the Monthly view

3. Updated tab definitions:
   - Removed the Monthly tab (previously index 2)
   - Removed the Calendar View tab (previously index 3 for admins)

4. Adjusted TabPanel indices:
   - Upload tab: Changed from index 4 to index 2
   - Holidays tab: Changed from index 5 to index 3
   - Reports tab: Changed from index 6 (or 3 for non-admins) to index 4 (or 2 for non-admins)

## Technical Impact

The removal of these tabs has simplified the UI and reduced the amount of code required. The remaining tabs (Daily, Weekly, Upload, Holidays, Reports) maintain their original functionality, with improvements to ensure stability and reliability.

## User Impact

Users now have a streamlined interface with fewer options, focusing on the most commonly used attendance views:

- **Daily View**: For day-to-day attendance management
- **Weekly View**: For weekly planning and overview
- **Reports**: For generating and viewing attendance reports (improved with better data handling and visualization)
- **Upload** (Admin only): For bulk data uploads
- **Holidays** (Admin only): For managing holidays

The Monthly view and Calendar view were determined to be less critical for everyday operations and have been removed to simplify the user experience.

## Related Improvements

As part of this update, we've also:

1. Fixed issues with the Reports tab to ensure data displays correctly
2. Added improved error handling throughout the attendance components
3. Connected staff type filtering to the Reports tab for consistent filtering across views
4. Enhanced visualizations to provide meaningful data even when information is limited
