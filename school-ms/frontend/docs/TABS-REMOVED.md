# Tabs Removed Documentation

## Overview

This document details the tabs that were removed from the Staff Attendance Management UI to simplify the interface and focus on the most used features.

## Tabs Removed

The following tabs have been removed from the Staff Attendance Management UI:

1. **Monthly Tab** - Provided a monthly view of staff attendance
2. **Calendar View Tab** - Provided a calendar visualization of attendance

## Changes Made

1. Removed imports for:
   - `CalendarMonth` icon from '@mui/icons-material'
   - `AttendanceCalendarView` component
   - `AttendanceMonthlyView` component

2. Removed state variable:
   - `selectedMonth` - Was used for the Monthly view

3. Updated tab definitions:
   - Removed the Monthly tab (previously index 2)
   - Removed the Calendar View tab (previously index 3 for admins)

4. Adjusted TabPanel indices:
   - Upload tab: Changed from index 4 to index 2
   - Holidays tab: Changed from index 5 to index 3
   - Reports tab: Changed from index 6 (or 3 for non-admins) to index 4 (or 2 for non-admins)

## Technical Impact

The removal of these tabs has simplified the UI and reduced the amount of code required. The remaining tabs (Daily, Weekly, Upload, Holidays, Reports) maintain their original functionality.

## User Impact

Users now have a streamlined interface with fewer options, focusing on the most commonly used attendance views:

- **Daily View**: For day-to-day attendance management
- **Weekly View**: For weekly planning and overview
- **Reports**: For generating and viewing attendance reports
- **Upload** (Admin only): For bulk data uploads
- **Holidays** (Admin only): For managing holidays

The Monthly view and Calendar view were determined to be less critical for everyday operations and have been removed to simplify the user experience.
