# React Import Fix

## Issue
We encountered an error in the Reports tab: `Uncaught ReferenceError: useEffect is not defined`

This error occurred despite having the correct import statement:
```typescript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
```

## Fix Applied
We solved this issue by restructuring the imports in `AttendanceReports.tsx`:

1. Added explicit imports for React and its hooks:
   ```typescript
   // React imports
   import * as React from 'react';
   import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
   ```

2. Organized the remaining imports into logical groups for better readability:
   - Material UI icons
   - Material UI components
   - Date pickers

## Root Cause
The error was likely due to:
1. A build/bundling issue where the hook imports were not being properly recognized
2. A potential circular dependency or import resolution problem
3. A cached version of the component that didn't have the correct import

By restructuring the imports to be more explicit and separating them clearly, we ensured that the React hooks were properly imported and available throughout the component.

## Prevention
For future components that use React hooks:
1. Import hooks explicitly at the top of the file
2. Consider using the `import * as React from 'react'` pattern for comprehensive access to React functionality
3. Group imports by category for better code organization
