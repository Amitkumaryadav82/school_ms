# Staff Attendance Service Fix

## Issue
The Staff Attendance dashboard was encountering an error stating `staffService.getAllStaff is not a function`. This occurred because the frontend code in `AttendanceDailyView.tsx` was calling a method that doesn't exist in the staffService implementation.

## Root Cause
In the staffService.ts file, the method to get all staff is called `getAll()`, not `getAllStaff()`. Additionally, there was a reference to a non-existent method called `getNonTeachingStaff()`.

## Fixes Applied

1. Updated `AttendanceDailyView.tsx` to call the correct method:
   ```typescript
   // Before
   staffService.getAllStaff()
   
   // After
   staffService.getAll()
   ```

2. Added the missing `getNonTeachingStaff()` method to staffService.ts:
   ```typescript
   // Get non-teaching staff (for attendance module)
   getNonTeachingStaff: async () => {
     try {
       const response = await api.get('staff', {
         params: {
           employmentStatus: 'ACTIVE',
           roleFilter: 'NonTeaching'
         }
       });
       // Apply type assertion to safely access response data
       const typedResponse = response as any;
       return typedResponse.data || [];
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Error fetching non-teaching staff:', error);
       return [];
     }
   }
   ```

## Future Recommendations

1. Consider adding more robust error handling in the API service to provide clearer error messages when methods don't exist.
2. Keep service method names consistent between the frontend and backend.
3. Implement TypeScript interfaces for service methods to catch these issues at compile time.

## Testing

To verify the fix, access the Staff Attendance dashboard and ensure:
1. The page loads without JavaScript errors
2. Staff data is properly displayed
3. Attendance can be marked or viewed properly
