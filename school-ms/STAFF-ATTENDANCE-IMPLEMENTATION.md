# Staff Attendance Module Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of the Staff Attendance module which replaces the previous Teacher Attendance module. The new system allows for managing attendance for all staff members, not just teachers.

## Backend Changes

### New Models and DTOs
1. `StaffAttendance.java`: Core entity representing a staff attendance record
2. `StaffAttendanceStatus.java`: Enum representing possible attendance statuses
3. `StaffAttendanceDTO.java`: Data transfer object for staff attendance
4. `BulkStaffAttendanceRequest.java`: DTO for bulk attendance operations

### Repository and Service
1. `StaffAttendanceRepository.java`: Repository interface for database operations
2. `StaffAttendanceService.java`: Service interface defining staff attendance operations
3. `StaffAttendanceServiceImpl.java`: Implementation of the service interface

### Controller
1. `StaffAttendanceController.java`: REST controller exposing attendance management endpoints

### Database Schema
Added a new `staff_attendance` table in the database with the following structure:
- `id`: Primary key
- `staff_id`: Foreign key to the staff table
- `attendance_date`: Date of the attendance record
- `status`: Attendance status (PRESENT, ABSENT, HALF_DAY, ON_LEAVE, HOLIDAY)
- `note`: Optional notes/comments for the attendance record
- `created_at`: Creation timestamp
- `updated_at`: Last update timestamp

## Frontend Changes

### New Components
1. `StaffAttendance.tsx`: Main page component for staff attendance management
2. Updated `AttendanceDailyView.tsx` to handle both teacher and staff attendance

### New Services
1. `staffAttendanceService.ts`: Service for interacting with the backend staff attendance API

### Navigation and Routing
1. Updated `Layout.tsx` to include staff attendance in the navigation menu
2. Added new route in `App.tsx` for the staff attendance page

## Migration Steps
1. Created database schema changes for the new staff attendance table
2. Implemented backend models, repositories, services, and controllers
3. Created frontend service and components
4. Updated navigation and routing to include the new module

## Usage
The new Staff Attendance module is accessible via the `/staff-attendance` route and provides the following features:
- Daily attendance tracking for all staff members
- Weekly and monthly attendance views
- Attendance reports and analytics
- Filtering by staff type (teaching/non-teaching/admin)
- Holiday management integration

## Next Steps
1. Testing and validation of the complete module
2. Migration of any existing teacher attendance data to the new system
3. User training and documentation
4. Continuous monitoring and feedback collection
