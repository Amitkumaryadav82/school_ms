# Holiday Attendance Debug Guide

## Problem Statement
Attendance is not being automatically marked as "HOLIDAY" for staff on holiday dates.

## Debugging Approach

### Added Logging

1. **HolidayServiceImpl.checkIfHoliday**
   - Added logging to show when the method is called
   - Shows whether a holiday was found for the requested date

2. **EmployeeAttendanceServiceImpl.isHoliday**
   - Added logging to show the result of holiday checks

3. **EmployeeAttendanceServiceImpl.getAttendanceByDate**
   - Added detailed logging for the holiday check
   - Shows when holiday attendance records are being created
   - Reports how many records exist before and after creation

4. **EmployeeAttendanceServiceImpl.createHolidayAttendanceForAllStaff**
   - Added logging to show how many active staff are found
   - Shows processing for each individual staff member

### Debugging Tools

Created a new debug controller: `HolidayDebugController`

1. **POST /api/debug/holidays/create-test-holiday**
   - Creates a test holiday for the current date
   - Useful for testing holiday functionality without needing the UI

2. **GET /api/debug/holidays/check-date**
   - Check if a specific date is a holiday
   - Can be used to verify the holiday detection is working

## Debugging Steps

1. **Verify Holiday Detection**
   - Create a test holiday using the debug endpoint
   - Check if the date is recognized as a holiday

2. **Check Staff Repository**
   - Verify that `findByIsActiveTrue()` is returning active staff members
   - Check if there's an issue with the Staff entity or isActive field

3. **Monitor Attendance Creation**
   - Watch the logs carefully during attendance creation
   - Verify that holiday attendance records are being created

4. **Database Inspection**
   - Directly check the `school_holidays` table to ensure holidays are saved
   - Check the `staff_attendance` table to see what records exist

5. **Check ThreadLocal Usage**
   - Verify that the ThreadLocal pattern for passing holiday information is working

## Possible Issues

1. **Holiday Detection**
   - The holiday might not be correctly recognized in the database
   - The `findByDate` method might not be working as expected

2. **Active Staff Retrieval**
   - There might be no active staff members in the database
   - The `isActive` field might not be set correctly

3. **Transaction Management**
   - Transaction boundaries might be preventing attendance creation

4. **Exception Handling**
   - Silent exceptions might be occurring during attendance creation

## Resolution Checklist

- [ ] Verify holidays exist in the database
- [ ] Confirm holiday detection is working correctly
- [ ] Ensure active staff are being found
- [ ] Check that attendance records are being created with HOLIDAY status
- [ ] Verify that the frontend is displaying the correct attendance status
