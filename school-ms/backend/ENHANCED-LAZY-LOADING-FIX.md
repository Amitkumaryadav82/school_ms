# Enhanced Staff Attendance Lazy Loading Fix

## Problem

After implementing initial eager loading fixes, we were still experiencing `LazyInitializationException` errors:

```
org.hibernate.LazyInitializationException: could not initialize proxy [com.school.core.model.Staff#9] - no Session
```

This error occurred in the method `getAttendanceByDate` when trying to access the `StaffRole` of a `Staff` entity. Even though we had configured JOIN FETCH for the Staff entity, the StaffRole was still being loaded lazily.

## Root Cause Refined

1. In our initial fix, we only eagerly loaded the `Staff` entity in `StaffAttendance`
2. When trying to access `staff.getStaffRole().getName()` in the `filterByEmployeeType` method, the session was closed
3. The issue occurred because we needed a multi-level JOIN FETCH to load both the Staff entity and its StaffRole

## Enhanced Solution

We've implemented the following enhancements:

1. **Updated JOIN FETCH queries to load both Staff and StaffRole**:
   ```java
   @Query("SELECT sa FROM StaffAttendance sa JOIN FETCH sa.staff s LEFT JOIN FETCH s.staffRole WHERE sa.attendanceDate = :date")
   ```
   - All repository methods now use two-level JOIN FETCH to load both Staff and its StaffRole
   - Using LEFT JOIN for StaffRole to handle staff members who might not have a role assigned

2. **Improved null handling in the filterByEmployeeType method**:
   - Added comprehensive null checks for Staff and StaffRole
   - Wrapped StaffRole access in a try-catch block to handle any remaining proxy issues
   - Added logging for troubleshooting

## Impact

With these enhanced changes:
- Staff attendance data can be loaded with all related entities in a single database query
- DTO conversion can safely access both Staff and StaffRole properties without session issues
- The code is robust against null values or missing relationships

## Testing

After implementing these changes:
1. Staff attendance should be viewable by date without LazyInitializationException
2. Filtering by employee type (TEACHING vs. NON_TEACHING) should work correctly
3. All attendance reports and views should display staff information properly

## Files Modified

- `StaffAttendanceRepository.java`: Enhanced JOIN FETCH queries to include StaffRole
- `EmployeeAttendanceServiceImpl.java`: Improved null handling and error handling in filterByEmployeeType
