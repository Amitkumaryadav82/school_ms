# Staff Attendance 409 Conflict Error Fix

## Issue Description
When marking staff attendance, a 409 Conflict error was occurring due to unique constraint violations when attempting to mark attendance for a staff member on a date that already had an attendance record.

Error message:
```
API Error Details: {status: 409, statusText: '', data: {…}, url: '/api/staff/attendance', method: 'post', …}
API Error from /api/staff/attendance: {status: 409, data: {…}, message: 'Request failed with status code 409', stack: 'AxiosError: Request failed with status code 409\n ...}
```

## Root Cause
The `StaffAttendance` entity has a unique constraint on the combination of `staff_id` and `attendance_date`:

```java
@Table(name = "staff_attendance", uniqueConstraints = @UniqueConstraint(columnNames = { "staff_id", "attendance_date" }))
```

The service had code to check for existing records, but it wasn't properly handling race conditions or other scenarios where the check might not catch the duplicate before the database constraint was violated.

## Fix Implemented
The `createAttendance` method in `EmployeeAttendanceServiceImpl` was updated to:

1. Explicitly search for existing attendance records for the same staff member and date
2. If an existing record is found, update it instead of trying to create a new one
3. Wrap the database operations in a try-catch block to handle any remaining race conditions or issues
4. Provide a more helpful error message when the constraint is violated

The `createBulkAttendance` method was similarly updated to use the fixed `createAttendance` method and handle exceptions gracefully, allowing other records in the batch to be processed even if some fail.

## Files Modified
- `EmployeeAttendanceServiceImpl.java`

## Testing the Fix
1. Use the restart script: `restart-after-conflict-fix.bat` or `restart-after-conflict-fix.sh`
2. Try marking attendance for the same staff member multiple times on the same date
3. The system should now update the existing record instead of throwing a 409 Conflict error

## Backup and Recovery
A backup of the fixed implementation is saved as `EmployeeAttendanceServiceImpl.java.fixed`.

If the file becomes corrupted or reverted, you can run:
```
fix-attendance-service.bat
```
to restore the fixed version.

## Technical Notes
The 409 Conflict error indicates a violation of database constraints, typically unique constraints. In this case, the system was trying to insert a duplicate record for the same staff member and date, which violated the unique constraint on the table.

The fix ensures proper "upsert" behavior, where existing records are updated rather than attempting to insert duplicates.
