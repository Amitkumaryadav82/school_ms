# Compilation Fixes for Staff Attendance Consolidation

## Fixed Issues

1. **BulkAttendanceRequest Method Issues**:
   - Created a new `EmployeeBulkAttendanceRequest` class to avoid conflicts with existing `BulkAttendanceRequest`
   - Updated imports and references in `EmployeeAttendanceService` and `EmployeeAttendanceServiceImpl`
   - Fixed method calls to use the correct field names and types

2. **Return Type Issues in EmployeeAttendanceController**:
   - Fixed type mismatch in `getAttendanceOverview` method by converting `Map<EmployeeAttendanceStatus, Long>` to a `Map<String, Object>`
   - Added proper conversion with HashMap to ensure type compatibility

3. **Missing Methods in StaffAttendanceService**:
   - Added missing methods to `StaffAttendanceService` interface:
     - `processAttendanceFile(MultipartFile file)`
     - `getMonthlyAttendanceReport(int year, int month)`
     - `getEmployeeAttendanceStats(Long staffId, LocalDate startDate, LocalDate endDate)`
     - `isHoliday(LocalDate date)`
   - Implemented these methods in `StaffAttendanceServiceImpl`
   - Added necessary import for `MultipartFile`

4. **Fixed Method References**:
   - Updated references to match existing repository method names
   - Added proper error handling
   - Implemented consistent behavior across services

## Implementation Summary

1. **Created new DTOs**:
   - `EmployeeBulkAttendanceRequest` - with proper fields for bulk operations

2. **Extended Service Interfaces**:
   - Added required methods to both interfaces for consistency

3. **Implemented Missing Methods**:
   - Added full implementations for all missing methods
   - Included necessary utility methods like `calculateWorkingDays`

4. **Type Conversion**:
   - Fixed incompatible type issues by adding proper conversion logic

These changes should resolve all the compilation errors and allow the application to build successfully.
