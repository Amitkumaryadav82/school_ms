# Staff Attendance Consolidation Implementation

## Completed:

1. Created a consolidated `EmployeeAttendanceController` to handle both teacher and staff attendance
   - Implemented all necessary endpoints with appropriate parameters
   - Added support for employee type filtering
   - Included holiday auto-marking in the API

2. Created necessary DTOs and models:
   - `EmployeeAttendanceDTO` for a unified attendance model
   - `EmployeeAttendanceStatus` enum for attendance status types
   - `BulkAttendanceRequest` for bulk attendance operations

3. Created service interfaces and implementation:
   - `EmployeeAttendanceService` interface defining all required methods
   - `EmployeeAttendanceServiceImpl` with placeholder implementations that handle holiday logic

4. Updated the frontend to use the consolidated services:
   - Created `employeeAttendanceService.ts` with all necessary API methods
   - Updated `AttendanceDailyView` component to use the consolidated service
   - Updated `StaffAttendance.tsx` to use the updated components

## Features Implemented:

1. **Consolidated Staff and Teacher Attendance**: Created a single service and controller for all employee attendance
2. **Admin Permissions**: Maintained existing admin checks for updating attendance
3. **Automatic Holiday Marking**: Added logic to automatically mark holidays in the attendance service
4. **Employee Type Filtering**: Added support for filtering by employee type (TEACHING/NON_TEACHING/ALL)

## To Be Completed:

1. **Database Implementation**:
   - Create/update the necessary database tables for employee attendance
   - Implement proper persistence in `EmployeeAttendanceServiceImpl`

2. **Frontend Updates**:
   - Update the remaining components (WeeklyView, MonthlyView, CalendarView, Reports)
   - Update attendance upload functionality to work with the consolidated service

3. **Migration Strategy**:
   - Create a data migration script to move existing attendance records to the new schema
   - Implement transition period where both old and new endpoints work in parallel
   
4. **Testing**:
   - Test all endpoints with various employee types
   - Verify holiday auto-marking works correctly
   - Test admin permissions to ensure proper access control

## Next Steps:

1. Complete the database entity implementation for consolidated attendance
2. Update all frontend components to use the new consolidated service
3. Create data migration strategy and scripts
4. Implement proper unit and integration tests
5. Deploy and verify functionality
