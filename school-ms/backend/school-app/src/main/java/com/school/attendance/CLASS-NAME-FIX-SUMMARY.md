# Class Name and File Name Mismatch Fix Summary

## Issue Description

There was a mismatch between the class name and file name in the employee attendance system:

- File: `EmployeeBulkAttendanceRequest.java` 
- Class: `BulkAttendanceRequest` (should have been `EmployeeBulkAttendanceRequest`)

This inconsistency caused confusion and made it difficult to track references across the codebase.

## Solution Applied

We renamed the class to match the file name:
- Changed the class name from `BulkAttendanceRequest` to `EmployeeBulkAttendanceRequest` in the file `EmployeeBulkAttendanceRequest.java`

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **Improved code consistency:** Class names now match their file names following Java conventions
2. **Better code navigation:** Easier to find references and dependencies
3. **Reduced confusion:** Clearer distinction between student and employee attendance DTOs
4. **Maintenance simplicity:** Prevents potential errors in future code changes

## Current System Design

The system now maintains two separate bulk attendance request classes:

1. `BulkAttendanceRequest` - Used for student attendance
   - Properties: `studentIds`, `date`, `status`, `remarks`
   - Used by: `AttendanceController`, `AttendanceService`

2. `EmployeeBulkAttendanceRequest` - Used for employee attendance (both teaching and non-teaching staff)
   - Properties: `attendanceDate`, `attendanceMap`, `remarks`, `employeeType`
   - Used by: `EmployeeAttendanceController`, `EmployeeAttendanceService`

This separation allows for specialized handling of student and employee attendance while maintaining a clean architecture.
