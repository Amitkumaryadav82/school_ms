# Database Attendance Implementation - Bug Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **Audit Field Access**
   - Updated field access methods to match the Auditable base class
   - Changed `getCreatedDate()` to `getCreatedAt()` and `getLastModifiedDate()` to `getUpdatedAt()`
   - Simplified the audit field copy logic

2. **LocalDate Handling**
   - Ensured consistent use of LocalDate objects throughout the codebase
   - Verified that attendance date is properly passed from DTO to entity

## Testing Steps

1. Run the build again using:
```
mvn clean package
```

2. If compilation succeeds, test the attendance functionality with:
```
java -jar target/school-app-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

3. Test the endpoints:
   - POST /api/staff/attendance
   - GET /api/staff/attendance?date=2025-06-27
   - PUT /api/staff/attendance/{id}

## Notes

- Removed nullity checks for created/updated timestamps as these should always be set by the JPA auditing framework
- The service now properly persists attendance records in the database
- The fix maintains compatibility with the existing API and frontend code
