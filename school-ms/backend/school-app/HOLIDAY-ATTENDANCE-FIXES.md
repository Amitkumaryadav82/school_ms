# Holiday Attendance Fixes

This document outlines the fixes implemented to address issues with holiday attendance marking and department display in the staff attendance system.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Department Not Displaying for Some Staff**
   - Added proper getter and setter methods for the department field in Staff.java
   - Ensured department information is correctly passed to the DTO objects

2. **Holiday Status Not Applying to All Staff**
   - Modified the HolidayAttendanceServiceImpl to always update attendance to HOLIDAY status for all active staff
   - Updated getAttendanceByDate in EmployeeAttendanceServiceImpl to ensure holiday attendance is processed for all staff
   - Added error handling to prevent failures when processing large numbers of staff

## Implementation Details

### Department Display Fix

The department information was not displaying because the Staff entity was missing proper getter and setter methods for the department field. These methods have been added:

```java
public String getDepartment() {
    return this.department;
}

public void setDepartment(String department) {
    this.department = department;
}
```

### Holiday Attendance Status Fix

The holiday attendance was not being applied to all staff because:

1. The system was only creating new holiday attendance records if none existed, but wasn't updating existing records consistently
2. We were checking if records existed before deciding whether to update them

The following changes were made:

1. Modified `getAttendanceByDate` to always call `holidayAttendanceService.ensureHolidayAttendance` for holidays
2. Updated `HolidayAttendanceServiceImpl.ensureHolidayAttendance` to always update existing records to HOLIDAY status
3. Added better error handling to prevent process termination if one staff record fails
4. Added additional logging for debugging

## Testing

To test the fixes, use the following endpoints:

1. `POST /api/debug/holiday-attendance-test/create-today-holiday-and-mark-attendance`
   - Creates a test holiday for the current date and marks attendance for all staff

2. `POST /api/debug/holiday-attendance-test/reprocess-attendance?date=2025-07-06`
   - Reprocesses attendance for a specific date, ensuring all staff have HOLIDAY status

3. `GET /api/debug/holiday-attendance/is-holiday?date=2025-07-06`
   - Checks if a specific date is a holiday

## Verification Steps

After deploying the fixes:

1. Open the staff attendance page and select a holiday date
2. Verify that all staff have their attendance marked as "HOLIDAY"
3. Verify that department information is displayed for all staff
4. Use the "Mark All Present" button to attempt to change the status and verify it doesn't override the holiday status
