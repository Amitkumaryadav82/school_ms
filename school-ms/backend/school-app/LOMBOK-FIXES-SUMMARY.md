# School Management System - Backend Build Fixes Summary

## Overview of Issues Fixed

### 1. ExamTypeDTO Issue
- The `ExamTypeDTO` class was correctly structured but was not being properly recognized by the compiler.
- This issue could be related to how the build process was handling the file.

### 2. Exam.java @Override Issue
- Fixed the `getId()` method in `Exam.java` by ensuring it properly overrides the method from `BaseEntity`.
- Added the `@Override` annotation to clearly mark the method as overriding a superclass method.

### 3. BulkUploadResponse Constructor Issue
- Fixed the usage of `BulkUploadResponse` in `StaffServiceImpl.java` by using the constructor that accepts three parameters: created count, updated count, and errors list.

### 4. Message and MessageDTO Issues
- Fixed the switch statement in `MessageService.java` to correctly use enum constants.
- Added explicit getter/setter methods to the `Message` class to ensure they are available even if Lombok processing fails.

### 5. SchoolHoliday and SchoolHolidayDTO Issues
- Added explicit getter and setter methods to both classes.
- Added a manual builder implementation to support the @Builder annotation functionality.

### 6. Student Model Issues
- Added explicit setter methods for the `Student` class to ensure they are available even if Lombok fails.

## Root Cause Analysis

The primary issue appears to be related to how Lombok annotations are being processed during the build. There could be several reasons for this:

1. Lombok might not be properly registered with the annotation processor.
2. There might be version incompatibilities between Lombok and the Java compiler.
3. The lombok.config file might not be properly configured or recognized.

## Proposed Long-Term Solutions

### Option 1: Ensure Proper Lombok Configuration
- Update the `lombok.config` file with proper settings.
- Verify that Lombok is correctly configured in the `pom.xml`.
- Make sure the project is using a compatible version of Lombok with the JDK.

### Option 2: Use Delombok as Part of the Build Process
- Incorporate the Delombok process into the build to explicitly generate the Java code from Lombok annotations.
- This would create explicit getters, setters, and other methods before compilation.

### Option 3: Supplement Lombok with Manual Implementations
- Keep using Lombok annotations for convenience.
- Add explicit implementations of critical methods to ensure they're available even if Lombok processing fails.

## Scripts Created

1. `fix-lombok-rebuild.bat` - Windows batch file to clean and rebuild the project with explicit Lombok configuration.
2. `fix-backend.sh` - Bash script for WSL to execute all fixes and run the build process.

## Next Steps

1. Run the provided scripts to fix and build the backend.
2. If build errors persist, check the logs to identify any remaining issues.
3. Consider setting up a pre-build process that uses Delombok to explicitly generate all the necessary methods.
4. Implement a more robust build process that can detect and handle Lombok-related issues automatically.

## Build Command

To build the project with all fixes applied, run:

```
cd c:\Users\amitk\Documents\school_ms\school-ms\
.\fix-lombok-rebuild.bat
```

Or using WSL:

```
cd /mnt/c/Users/amitk/Documents/school_ms/school-ms/
./fix-backend.sh
```
