# School Management System Backend Build Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ExamTypeDTO Issue
- The ExamTypeDTO class already existed but had issues
- Verified it has the correct implementation with name field

### 2. Exam.java Method Override Issue
- Removed the @Override annotation from the getId() method in Exam.java:
```java
public Long getId() {
    return super.getId();
}
```

### 3. Staff.java Missing Methods
- Added missing setter methods to Staff.java:
  - setFirstName(String firstName)
  - setLastName(String lastName)
  - setEmail(String email)
  - setRole(String role)
  - setAddress(String address)
  - setDateOfBirth(LocalDate dateOfBirth)
  - setDepartment(String department)
  - setActive(boolean active)

### 4. BulkUploadResponse Constructor Issue
- Fixed usage of BulkUploadResponse in StaffServiceImpl:
  - Changed from `new BulkUploadResponse(created, updated, errors)`
  - To using the two-parameter constructor and setter:
```java
BulkUploadResponse response = new BulkUploadResponse(created, updated);
response.setErrors(errors);
return response;
```

### 5. MessageService Issues
- Fixed enum constant references in switch statement:
  - Changed from using unqualified constants like `EMERGENCY_ALERT`
  - To using qualified constants like `MessageType.EMERGENCY_ALERT`
- Added convertToDTO method to convert Message to MessageDTO

## Next Steps
1. Run the build command to verify all issues are resolved
2. Check for any new errors that might appear
3. Update test cases if needed
4. Ensure the application runs correctly

## Note
The build command couldn't be executed within this context. After making these changes, run:
```
cd c:\Users\amitk\Documents\school_ms\school-ms\backend\school-app
mvn clean install
```
