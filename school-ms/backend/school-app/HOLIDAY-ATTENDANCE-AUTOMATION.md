# Automatic Holiday Attendance Implementation

## Overview

The system now automatically marks staff attendance as "HOLIDAY" on days that are defined as holidays in the system. This ensures consistent attendance records and simplifies attendance management.

## Key Features

1. **Auto-detection of Holidays**: When viewing attendance for a specific date, the system checks if the date is a holiday.

2. **Automatic Attendance Creation**: If the day is a holiday and no attendance records exist yet, the system automatically creates attendance records for all active staff members with the status "HOLIDAY".

3. **Holiday Information in Attendance Records**: The system includes the holiday name and description in the attendance record's note field.

4. **Override Protection**: If someone tries to mark attendance on a holiday with a non-holiday status, the system automatically changes it to "HOLIDAY" status.

5. **Retroactive Application**: When viewing attendance for a past holiday date, the system will automatically create holiday records if none exist.

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

1. **Enhanced `checkIfHoliday` Method**: Modified to include the holiday name and description in the response.

2. **New `HolidayThreadLocal` Utility**: Created a ThreadLocal utility to pass holiday details between service layers without changing method signatures.

3. **Automatic Record Creation**: Added a new `createHolidayAttendanceForAllStaff` method that creates holiday attendance records for all active staff members.

4. **Holiday Status Enforcement**: Updated the `createAttendance` method to enforce HOLIDAY status for holidays and include the holiday name and description.

5. **On-Demand Generation**: Enhanced the `getAttendanceByDate` method to check for holidays and create records as needed.

### How It Works

1. When a user views daily attendance for a specific date, the system:
   - Checks if the date is a holiday
   - If it is and no records exist, creates HOLIDAY attendance for all active staff
   - Returns the attendance records (including the newly created ones)

2. When a user manually marks attendance on a holiday:
   - The system automatically sets the status to HOLIDAY
   - Includes the holiday name and description in the reason field
   - Ensures consistency in holiday attendance records

## Testing

To test this feature:

1. Add a new holiday through the holiday management interface
2. Navigate to the "Daily Attendance" view for that date
3. Verify that all staff members have HOLIDAY status automatically
4. Try to mark a staff member as present on that day
5. Verify that the system maintains the HOLIDAY status

## Benefits

- Ensures consistent attendance records
- Eliminates manual work of marking holidays for all staff
- Provides clear information about the specific holiday in attendance records
- Prevents accidental marking of other attendance statuses on holidays
- Simplifies attendance reporting and analysis
