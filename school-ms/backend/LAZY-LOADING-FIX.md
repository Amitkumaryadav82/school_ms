# Staff Attendance Lazy Loading Fix

## Problem

After fixing the foreign key constraint for the `staff_attendance` table to reference `school_staff` instead of the old `staff` table, a new issue emerged:

```
org.hibernate.LazyInitializationException: could not initialize proxy [com.school.core.model.StaffRole#1] - no Session
```

This was occurring in the `convertToDTO` method of `EmployeeAttendanceServiceImpl` when trying to access the `staff.getStaffRole().getName()` property.

## Root Cause

1. The `Staff` entity has a relationship with `StaffRole` that is lazily loaded (`@ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)`)
2. The `StaffAttendance` entity also has a lazy relationship to `Staff`
3. When retrieving `StaffAttendance` objects and trying to access nested objects like `StaffRole` outside of a transaction, Hibernate throws a `LazyInitializationException`

## Solution: Eager Loading with JOIN FETCH

We implemented the following changes to fix the issue:

1. **Updated StaffAttendanceRepository methods with JOIN FETCH**:
   - All query methods now use `JOIN FETCH sa.staff` to eagerly load the Staff entity
   - Added a new `findByIdWithStaff` method that eagerly loads Staff when querying by ID

2. **Updated StaffRepository with eager role loading**:
   - Added a `findByIdWithRole` method that uses `LEFT JOIN FETCH s.staffRole` to eagerly load the role
   - Updated service code to use this method instead of the standard `findById`

3. **Improved null safety**:
   - Enhanced the `convertToDTO` method with robust null checking for Staff and StaffRole
   - Added fallback logic when staff role information is unavailable

## Impact

These changes ensure that when attendance records are loaded, all the related entities required for DTO conversion (Staff and StaffRole) are loaded in a single database query, avoiding the LazyInitializationException.

## Testing

After implementing these changes, verify that:

1. Staff attendance can be marked successfully
2. Staff attendance details can be viewed without errors
3. Attendance reports show correct staff role information

## Files Modified

- `StaffAttendanceRepository.java`: Added JOIN FETCH queries and new findByIdWithStaff method
- `EmployeeAttendanceServiceImpl.java`: Updated to use findByIdWithStaff and improved null handling
- `StaffRepository.java`: Using findByIdWithRole for eager loading of staff role
