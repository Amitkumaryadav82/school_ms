# Guide to Remove com.example Package References

After migrating all files from the `com.example` package structure to their appropriate locations, follow these steps to completely remove references to these packages from your application:

## 1. Update Application Class

In `SchoolApplication.java`, remove all references to `com.example.schoolms`:

```java
@ComponentScan(basePackages = { "com.school" })
@EntityScan(basePackages = { "com.school" })
@EnableJpaRepositories(basePackages = { "com.school" })
```

## 2. Update Component Qualifiers

1. Check all `@Autowired` annotations with `@Qualifier` that might reference beans from the `com.example` packages
2. Update them to use the new bean names or remove the qualifier if it's no longer needed

## 3. Update Import Statements

1. Throughout the project, replace all imports of `com.example.*` classes with their new counterparts
2. Update any fully qualified class names that use `com.example.*`

## 4. Update Configuration Files

Check and update any configuration files (application.yml, application.properties) that may have references to `com.example` package names.

## 5. Verify References in XML Files

If your project uses any XML configuration (though unlikely in a Spring Boot application), check for `com.example` references there as well.

## 6. Update Tests

Make sure all test classes are updated to use the new package structure and class names.

## 7. Delete com.example Package Structure

Once all references are migrated, you can safely delete the entire `com.example` package structure from your project.

## 8. Final Verification

1. Run a full build to ensure everything compiles
2. Run all tests to ensure functionality is maintained
3. Start the application to verify it runs without any errors related to missing classes or beans

## Note

This migration should be done gradually, testing thoroughly at each step to ensure the application continues to function correctly.
