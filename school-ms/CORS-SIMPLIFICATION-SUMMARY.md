# Simplified CORS Configuration Summary

## Problem Statement

The School Management System had multiple redundant CORS configurations spread across different files and annotations. This caused:

1. Inconsistent behavior in different environments
2. Difficulty in diagnosing CORS issues
3. Complexity when adding new origins or changing CORS policies
4. Potential conflicts between different configuration methods

## Solution

We've implemented a simplified CORS configuration approach:

1. **Centralized Configuration**: All CORS settings are now managed in `CorsConfig.java`, which reads values from `application.properties`.

2. **Removed Redundancies**: 
   - Eliminated duplicate CORS config in `WebSecurityConfig.java`
   - Removed inline CORS config from `SecurityConfig.java`
   - Removed `@CrossOrigin` annotation from `AuthController`

3. **Enhanced Diagnostics**: Added comprehensive CORS diagnostics in `authDiagnostic.ts`

4. **Added API Health Endpoint**: Created `/api/auth/health` for monitoring and diagnostics

5. **Updated Frontend Configuration**: Enhanced the frontend environment settings to better support CORS configuration

## Files Changed

1. Backend:
   - `CorsConfig.java` - Updated to use properties
   - `WebSecurityConfig.java` - Simplified to a placeholder
   - `SecurityConfig.java` - Updated to use centralized CORS filter
   - `AuthController.java` - Removed @CrossOrigin, added health endpoint

2. Frontend:
   - `environment.ts` - Added CORS configuration section
   - `authDiagnostic.ts` - Implemented comprehensive diagnostics
   - `reset-cors.ps1` - Updated to work with new configurations

## Testing

To test the changes:

1. Start the backend application
2. Verify the health endpoint responds correctly: `GET /api/auth/health`
3. Test login functionality from different origins
4. Use the authDiagnostic utility to verify CORS configuration
