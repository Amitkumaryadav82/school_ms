# Code Consolidation Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **JPA Entity Name Conflicts:**
   - Fixed `DuplicateMappingException` for Staff entities by assigning unique entity names:
     - `CoreStaff` for `com.school.core.model.Staff`
     - `HrmStaff` for `com.school.hrm.entity.Staff`
     - `StaffModule` for `com.school.staff.model.Staff`
     - `ExampleStaff` for `com.example.schoolms.model.Staff`
   
   - Fixed `DuplicateMappingException` for TeacherDetails entities by assigning unique entity names:
     - `CoreTeacherDetails` for `com.school.core.model.TeacherDetails`
     - `StaffModuleTeacherDetails` for `com.school.staff.model.TeacherDetails`
     - `ExampleTeacherDetails` for `com.example.schoolms.model.TeacherDetails`

2. **JPQL Queries Fixed:**
   - Updated JPQL queries in repositories to use the correct entity name instead of the class name
   - Added proper @Query annotations to ensure all repositories reference the correct entity

## Consolidation Progress

1. **New Consolidated Entities Created:**
   - `com.school.core.model.TeacherDetails` - The consolidated entity for teacher details
   - Updated `com.school.core.model.Staff` to reference the consolidated TeacherDetails

2. **New Consolidated Repositories Created:**
   - `com.school.core.repository.TeacherDetailsRepository` - The consolidated repository for teacher details

3. **Migration Utilities Created:**
   - `com.school.core.adapter.EntityAdapter` - Adapter class to convert between different entity types

## Migration Plan

A comprehensive migration plan has been created in the `MIGRATION-STEPS.md` file outlining:
1. The entity naming strategy to avoid conflicts
2. The consolidation path for each entity type
3. The implementation phases from entity naming fixes to removal of legacy code
4. Testing strategy for each consolidation step

## Next Steps

1. Update service layer to use consolidated entities and repositories
2. Update controllers to use consolidated services
3. Properly deprecate and eventually remove legacy code from the `com.example.schoolms` package
4. Complete unit and integration tests for consolidated components

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Code Structure:**
   - Single source of truth for each entity type
   - Clearer package organization with logical separation of concerns

2. **Improved Maintainability:**
   - Reduced duplication means fewer places to make changes
   - More consistent API across the application

3. **Better Performance:**
   - Elimination of costly entity conversion operations between different representations
   - More efficient database operations with a consolidated schema
