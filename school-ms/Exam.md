# Exam Module Rework Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive strategy for reworking the Exam module to support flexible, reusable subject/exam configurations per class with theory/practical splits and copy/edit features.

## Current State Analysis (Legacy System)
The existing Examination Management module provides comprehensive examination management but has architectural limitations that require a complete rework for modern requirements.

### Legacy Architecture

#### Backend (Spring Boot) - Current Implementation

#### Core Models
- **Exam**: Represents an examination event with properties like name, subject, grade, examDate, description, totalMarks, passingMarks, and examType (MIDTERM, FINAL, QUIZ, ASSIGNMENT).
- **ExamConfiguration**: Defines settings for exams including theoryMaxMarks, practicalMaxMarks, passingPercentage, isActive, and requiresApproval.
- **ExamBlueprint**: Defines the structure and marking scheme of an examination, containing chapterDistributions.
- **ChapterDistribution**: Defines how questions are distributed across chapters with properties like chapterName, questionType, questionCount, totalMarks, and weightagePercentage.
- **QuestionPaper**: Contains actual questions based on the blueprint with properties like title, createdBy, approvalStatus, approvedBy, approvalDate, comments, and timeAllotted.
- **Question**: Individual questions with questionText, questionType, options, correctAnswer, marks, difficulty, and chapterName.
- **QuestionSection**: Sections within a paper with name, questionType, totalQuestions, mandatoryQuestions, and marksPerQuestion.
- **QuestionPaperStructure**: Defines the structure of papers with totalQuestions, mandatoryQuestions, optionalQuestions, totalMarks, and sections.
- **ExamResult**: Stores individual student results for an exam.
- **DetailedExamResult**: Stores question-wise marks for detailed analysis.
